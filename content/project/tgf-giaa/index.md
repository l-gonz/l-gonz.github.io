## Overview

This project was developed as the end-of-degree project for my bachelor in Aerospace Engineering. You can find the project report in the [university's archive](https://burjcdigital.urjc.es/handle/10115/25414).

This project explored the integration of computer vision techniques into unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control systems, leveraging the PX4 open-source autopilot platform. The primary goal was to create a system capable of autonomous tracking and following a human target, using affordable hardware and real-time image analysis.

Two control solutions were developed: a **hand-gesture-based control mechanism** (proof-of-concept) and a more advanced **human-following control system**, showcasing the adaptability of vision-based controls in UAVs. Simulations and flight tests validated the effectiveness of these solutions, paving the way for future improvements in UAV autonomy.

- Developed a hand-gesture-based control mechanism to test basic integration between the PX4 platform and MediaPipe.
- Used AirSim for initial validation and refinement.

### Phase 2: Human-Following Control
- Designed an onboard system to detect and track a person using the droneâ€™s camera.
- Tuned PID controllers for precise tracking and movement.
- Conducted comprehensive testing in both simulated and real-world environments.

### Phase 3: Real-World Validation
- Built and calibrated a custom quadcopter.
- Integrated hardware and tested control solutions in outdoor flights.
- Identified and resolved challenges in vision-based control under varying conditions.
