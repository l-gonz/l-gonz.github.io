## About This Project
RallyOTA is a custom-built Bluetooth remote controller designed for motorcycle rally enthusiasts (me ðŸ˜Š). Built around the ESP32 microcontroller, this compact and versatile remote makes it easy to switch between rally roadbook navigation and mapping apps while riding. The controller also supports over-the-air (OTA) updates, so you can improve its functionality without unscrewing a single bolt.

The board and other physical components are enclosed on holder designed in Fusion 360 and 3D printed using PETG filament.

This project combines hardware tinkering with Arduino programming and 3D modelling, creating a robust solution that has been tested in real-world motorcycle navigation challenges.

## How I Built It
### Design and Assembly
- **Hardware**: The controller uses an ESP32-C3 microcontroller, three push buttons, and a rocker switch to provide intuitive navigation control. It connects to the motorcycleâ€™s onboard power supply via USB for consistent power.
- **Software**: The code includes two main modes:
  - **Rally Mode**: Navigate a roadbook by advancing and retracting pages or adjusting the trip meter.
  - **Navigation Mode**: Control zoom and centering in OsmAnd maps using button inputs.
- **OTA Updates**: With ESP2SOTA, the remote can receive firmware updates over Wi-Fi, making it easy to add new features.

### Key Challenges
- Ensuring Bluetooth stability for a reliable connection during rides.
- Integrating OTA updates into the ESP32 firmware while maintaining security and usability.
